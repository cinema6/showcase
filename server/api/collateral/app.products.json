        "description": "Do you have a huge pile of coins waiting to be counted?  Then this app is for you.  Group the coins by type, point the camera at each group, and let the app do the counting!\n\nEven if you lack a huge pile of coins, this is still a cool app for showing off your iOS device to friends!\n\nDisclaimer: To be absolutely clear, this app does not identify your coins.  You have to tell it what type of coins it is looking at.  Think of it more as an advanced coin tallying app.\n\nThis app works by using image recognition libraries from the OpenCV project to detect circular objects in the camera's view.  The circle detection sensitivity can be adjusted with a single slider.  A convenient user interface assists in tallying the sum of the coins.\n\nDetailed Instructions:\n\n1. Download this app.\n\n2. Separate your pile of coins.\n\n3. Spread the coins out in each group so that no coins are on top of each other, and so that the groups are clearly separated.\n\n4. Start the app.\n\n5. Point the camera at one group such that only that group is visible on the screen.\n\n6. Adjust the detection sensitivity slider until green circles are placed around every coin in the group, and no extra circles appear anywhere else.\n\n7. The app's image processing algorithms automatically self-calibrate based on the current lighting and focus to identify the coins.  It displays the number of coins it counts in the bottom right hand corner.\n\n8. When the number of coins stabilizes, select the coin type and click add.\n\n9. The dollar amount corresponding to the number of coins is added to the total.\n\nBy downloading and/or using this apps, the user agrees to the app store End User License Agreements, as well as the Terms and Conditions Listed in the app's info screen and in this document.\n\nTips:\n\n- Place the coins on a solid background, like a blank white sheet of paper, for best results.\n\n- Make sure the coin detection area is well-illuminated.\n\n- For obtaining more accurate counts, make sure that none of the green circles are flickering, and that there are no extra green circles.  The sensitivity slider, lighting, and background all influence accuracy.\n\nUsage Terms and Conditions:\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED \"AS IS,\" AND COPYRIGHT HOLDERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS OR OTHER RIGHTS.",

Additionally, you can press the coin count underneath each coin and a convenient message box will prompt you to enter in specific coin count. \n\nThe Coin Counting Calculator can be used to count money and teach coin values.

        "description": "iPocketChange is a new and useful way to keep track of your coins.\n\nDo you have any coins in your pocket?\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n* Saves the quantity of each coin that exists in your wallet.\n* Tells you whether you can pay for something with exact change.\n* Automatically subtracts the amount you're paying from what you have.\n* Saves you money by keeping track of your coins and helping you to utilize them.\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\n\nA Subway sandwich is $5.41, including tax. You have six $1 bills, 1 quarter, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 4 pennies. What would you give the cashier? If this question takes you more than 10 seconds to answer, stop fussing. Use iPocketChange, and save yourself the time and hassle.\n\nYou do these kinds of transactions every day. Eventually, we each have an enormous jar of coins. It's a hassle to count and wrap the coins, and it costs money to pay a machine to count them. iPocketChange is the solution. It keeps track of your change at the touch of a finger.\n\nWHY I USE IT:\n\nI have a bunch of coins in my wallet right now. Although I know there are coins in there, I have no idea which coins. It turns out that I have 6 quarters, 4 dimes, 1 nickel, and 1 penny. But once I dump these back in my wallet, I'll have no recollection of how many that was. All I'll know is: \"I have a bunch of coins in my wallet.\"\n\nUSAGE SCENARIO:\n\niPocketChange tracks the change you get, as you get it. When you pay for something with cash, you get a few coins back. Take out your iPhone or iPod touch, open iPocketChange, and tap the coins you just received. Sleep your device, and you're done. It's quick and easy. The app saves the information automatically, and now it knows what's in your wallet-- or purse, or whatever.\n\nNow here's the cool part. The next time you go to buy something, let's say the total is $8.58. Normally, you'd have no idea whether you need to pay $9 and get change, or if you have the right coins to pay for it exactly. Pull out your iPhone or iPod touch, and on iPocketChange's first screen, there's a sliding wheel for selecting the cents part of the item's cost. Scroll to 58, and the app will tell you whether you have exact change, based on what it knows is in your wallet. Let's say you have exact change. Tap \"Pay\", and the app automatically subtracts from your wallet's contents 2 quarters, 1 nickel, and 3 pennies-- 58 cents. Sleep the device, and pull out your wallet. You can be confident that you have the right coins to make exact change.\n\nFUN EXTRAS:\n\n* Original photos taken with a professional digital SLR camera.\n* Coin sound.\n* Accelerometer support: move the coins around the screen!\n\niPocketChange currently supports only U.S. currency, but if you're interested, we may add support for other currencies.\n\nDeveloped at USC, the University of Southern California\nPublished by GreenGar Studios\nFormerly Gengar Studios",

The total amount of money is then displayed nice, neat,\nand easy to read under each category, as well as in the separate Totals section at the bottom.\n\nIf you are interested in knowing your total profits, the default starting amount is 100, but by changing the value of the \"Starting Amount\" box in the Totals section, your profits can be  based on any whole or fractional dollar amount. If you are counting an old jar of change, set the \"Starting Amount\" to 0, or just look at the \"Grand Totals\" line for the amount you have.",

That's it: no fuss, no clutter and no distracting animations. \n\nSo, don't bother with a generic app that claims to work with all card games under the sun: YGO Counter is optimised for Yu-Gi-Oh and so provides an optimal experience for duelists who want the best.",

It supports multiple currencies including GBP (£), USD ($), EUR (€), DKK (Kr) and AUD ($). \n\nIt never forgets how much money you have in your virtual bank so you can always keep track of your money.\n\nHere's how you can use Count My Coins\n\nCoin counter:\n\nImagine the scenario: You empty your piggy bank after a good few months of dropping in the odd bit of change and fluff you have in your pocket. The day finally comes when you decide to take it to the bank. You empty the coins out onto your table and slowly move each coin to it's own separate pile, counting in your head as you go. This nearly always leads to losing track of how much money you have and a waste of an afternoon.\n\nWith Count My Coins, this is a thing of the past. Simply select the coin and press the screen to increment the amount.\n\nCoin or savings tracker:\n\nWhenever you drop a bit of money into your piggy bank, simply open up the app and tap the amount you have just dropped in. Close the app and forget about it! We remember how much money you had whenever you close the app so you will never lose your data!\n\nCurrency converter :\n\nIf you change the currency while tracking your coins, you now have the option to convert your current money to the destination currency!\n\nShop spending tracker:\n\nAs you walk round the store, putting things in your basket, simply enter the cost of each item into Count My Coins and when you get to the checkout you can see exactly how much you have spent!\n\nWe would love to add more currencies. If we are missing your currency please ask for it in the reviews and we will aim to add it in the next update!\n\nAny feedback, bugs or suggestions please send to http://twitter.com/treeba",

For craftsmen, plumber and others who work on a time basis, this app can be very useful. With this application the wage can be billed precisely on second.\n\nOr maybe you want to see how fast your favorite football or tennis Star earns his money in a few minutes? Then this app is just right for you.\n\nAnother advantage of this app is that, if the counter was a once started, you can close it without problems or even turn your device off. And the next time you start the app you can still see how much you earned in that period. So the battery runtime of your iPad or iPhone can be significantly extended.\n\nPerhaps you want to know how much money you earn in your sleep?\nOr do you just watch me, how your earnings every second rising? \n\nThen the Salary Counter is the right app for you ;)",

        "description": "TallyPad is a feature-rich fully-customizable tally counter for the iPad and iPhone. Just tap or swipe your finger in one of the designated counting areas to add or subtract from the corresponding tally count. \n\nAppAdvice.com describes TallyPad as the “essential [counting app] for those dealing with multiple tallies and have power user needs.”  http://goo.gl/gurzt\n\nTallyPad is great for just about any counting project:\n\n- Scorekeeping (especially board games like Scrabble)\n- Surveys\n- Tracking calories or diet points\n- Counting money and loose change\n- School projects\n- Household Projects\n- Voting and Informal elections\n\nWhat makes TallyPad different from all other counting applications is that you can assign customizable values to three different finger gestures. For example, you can set TallyPad to add 1 to the tally count for a single finger tap, 5 for a vertical swipe and 10 for a horizontal swipe. You get to choose the values. Also, you are not limited to whole numbers: Just switch TallyPad to decimal or money mode to add decimal values.\n\nYou can assign a multiplier to each counting area. The multipliers are applied to each counting area independent of the values assigned to finger gestures.\n\nTallyPad implements AV Out and AirPlay Mirroring with AppleTV. You can display your tallies on an external screen! This is great for keeping score at sporting events, family game night, or displaying items on a television in the classroom.\n\nBecause TallyPad saves all your custom-named tallies, you can keep track of a virtually unlimited number of tallies and come back to them later. You can also assign names to the three tally categories in each tally project. Also, the TallyPad user interface was designed to allow you to add tallies by tapping and swiping without having to look down at the device. This way you can keep your eyes on what you are counting--not on the iPhone or iPad.\n\nAnd, by popular request, version 4.0 adds more tally areas. The iPad now supports 8 tally areas. And, if you have the iPhone 5, and additional (5th) tally area has been added. Also, landscape orientation support for the iPad is back. The user interface has been redesigned for ease of use. Finally, the TV Out and AirPlay interface has been updated.\n\n***IMPORTANT NOTE***\nIf the app is crashing after installing the update, please delete the app and reinstall it. You will not be charged for the purchase/update.",

The popular Money Counting Calculator uses realistic coin buttons for the penny, nickel, dime, quarter, half dollar, and coin dollar. Additionally, the Money Counting Calculator uses doll buttons for the one-dollar bill, five-dollar bill, ten-dollar bill, twenty-dollar bill, fifty-dollar bill, and the one hundred dollar bill.\n\nThe Money Counting Calculator has a display with the cent sign (¢), dollar sign ($), and 2-digit decimals. When a currency button is pushed, they add their money value to the amount at the top of the screen based upon the number of times they are pushed. The count for each currency is updated underneath each currency image. Additionally, you can press the currency count underneath each coin and a convenient message box will prompt you to enter in specific coin count.\n\nThe Money Counting Calculator can be used to count money and teach currency values. You can set the function of the calculator to add or subtract. In addition, a convenient toggle button allows you to switch between coins and dollars.",

From pills on a countertop, coins on a table, and cells on a microscopic slide.  Find Circles is a crucial tool where repetitive counting is necessary.  Using OpenCV to allow the computer to 'see', Find Circles is fully adjustable to fit a wide variety of tasks.    It uses multiple phases of image processing to achieve this task.  What used to require a mainframe to run, now can be run on your device.  Use the same algorithm factories have been using since the 80's to count inventory.",
